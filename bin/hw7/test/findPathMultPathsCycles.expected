# tests for graphs with paths that include cycles

created graph g 

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g
added node n4 to g

added edge 1.000 from n1 to n2 in g
added edge 1.000 from n2 to n3 in g
added edge 1.000 from n3 to n4 in g
added edge 3.000 from n1 to n3 in g
added edge 0.100 from n2 to n1 in g
added edge 0.100 from n3 to n1 in g
added edge 0.100 from n3 to n2 in g

path from n1 to n4:
n1 to n2 with weight 1.000
n2 to n3 with weight 1.000
n3 to n4 with weight 1.000
total cost: 3.000
