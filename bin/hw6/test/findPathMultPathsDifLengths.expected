created graph g 

added node c1 to g
added node c2 to g
added node c3 to g
added node c4 to g
added node c5 to g

added edge f from c1 to c2 in g
added edge a from c1 to c4 in g

added edge d from c2 to c3 in g
added edge b from c2 to c1 in g
added edge a from c2 to c4 in g
added edge c from c2 to c5 in g

added edge a from c4 to c5 in g
added edge a from c5 to c3 in g

path from c1 to c3:
c1 to c2 via f 
c2 to c3 via d
