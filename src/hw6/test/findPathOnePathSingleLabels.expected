# One path, where the path only includes single labels between two nodes 

created graph g 

added node char1 to g
added node char2 to g
added node char3 to g
added node char4 to g

added edge label1 from char1 to char2 in g
added edge label2 from char2 to char3 in g
added edge label3 from char3 to char4 in g

path from char1 to char4:
char1 to char2 via label1
char2 to char3 via label2
char3 to char4 via label3
