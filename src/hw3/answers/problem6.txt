a. Fibonacci failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test because Fibonnaci threw an 
   IllegalArgument exception when getFibTerm was called with a parameter of 0, instead of 
   returning a 1. To fix this, I changed the first if condition within getFibterm to n < 0 
   instead of n <= 0. 
   
b. Fibonacci failed the testBaseCase test for the same reason it failed 
   testThrowsIllegalArgumentException on a parameter of 0. My fix for this test also 
   fixed the testBaseCase problem. 

c. Fibonacci failed the testInductiveCase test for two reasons. First, when getFibTerm
   was passed 2 it returned a 1 instead of a 2. I fixed this by changing the if
   condition on the based case from n <= 2 returning 1 to n < 2 returning 1. Second, 
   for all inputs greater than 2, getFibTerm was taking the difference between the 
   previous two number instead of adding them, so I adjusted the code accordingly.
