a. 
	* Because the field "volume" and constructor parameter "volume" have the same name, 
	  without specifying the field as this.volume the field will not be set. 
	* The getVolume method always returns 0 instead of the contents of the volume field.

b. 
    * Maintaining the total volume of the Balls in BallContainer is the better option
      because it requires very little storage and no calculations are needed for any
      call on getVolume(). Otherwise, each call would have to perform the same, and
      possibly very long calculation, each time. 

c.  
	* One way to implement getBallsFromSmallest is to maintain a sorted list of the 
	  balls. Another way is to add all the balls to a list and sort that list when 
	  getBallsFromSmallest is called. 
	  
	* The first method requires more calculation for add and remove calls, but each
	  insert into a sorted list is unlikely to take long in comparison to sorting
	  the entire unsorted list every time the getBallsFromSmallest method is called.
