Model
	My model involves three classes. The first is MapParser, which takes input files 
	and parses the data into usable structures. The second in MapPaths, which is the major
	lifter for the model, storing all relevant information for the map. Associated with it is
	the final class, Connection, which can store information for any given pair of coordinates
	in the MapPath. 

Controller
	The controller involves only the main method of the MapMain class. This method asks 
	for user input and calls other methods to access information in the MapPath for the
	campus map. 
	
View
	The view involves the MapMain class, including the methods main, printPath, printMenu, and 
	printBuildings. These methods all get information from MapPath and convert it into 
	formatted Strings that are printed out to the user. The part of the view that is part of
	main only involves prompting the user for information, not any accessing of the MapPath
	or display of request information.
