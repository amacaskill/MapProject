created graph graph1

added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1

added edge e1 from n2 to n1 in graph1
added edge e1 from n3 to n1 in graph1
added edge e2 from n4 to n1 in graph1

the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(e1)
the children of n3 in graph1 are: n1(e1)
the children of n4 in graph1 are: n1(e2)
