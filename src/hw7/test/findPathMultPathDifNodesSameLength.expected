# tests find path for multiple paths of the same length that go through different nodes

created graph g 

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g
added node n4 to g
added node n5 to g

added edge 0.100 from n1 to n2 in g
added edge 0.010 from n2 to n3 in g
added edge 0.200 from n1 to n4 in g
added edge 0.010 from n4 to n3 in g
added edge 0.010 from n1 to n5 in g
added edge 0.200 from n5 to n3 in g

path from n1 to n3:
n1 to n2 with weight 0.100
n2 to n3 with weight 0.010
total cost: 0.110
