# tests that the least weighted path is chosen among paths of different lengths

created graph g 

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g
added node n4 to g
added node n5 to g

added edge 5.000 from n1 to n3 in g
added edge 0.100 from n1 to n2 in g 
added edge 0.100 from n2 to n3 in g 
added edge 0.010 from n1 to n4 in g 
added edge 0.500 from n4 to n5 in g 
added edge 0.100 from n5 to n3 in g 

path from n1 to n3:
n1 to n2 with weight 0.100
n2 to n3 with weight 0.100
total cost: 0.200
